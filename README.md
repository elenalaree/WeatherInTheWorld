# WeatherInTheWorld

Weather in the World was created to display weather today and a five day forecast. It was built using a combination of Javascript, html, and css. Open Weather API was used to call the data. 

When a city is searched, the weather is displayed to the side with a day card and five small day cards. On the main card, name, date, a weather icon, temperature, humidity, and UV index is displayed. The UV Index is color coded by severity. On the forecast cards, the date, weather icon, temperature, and humidity is displayed for the next 5 days. When a city is searched, the last searched city is at the top of the list. If no city is input, the input field will flash red. If no city is found, the user is informed that no city was found.
